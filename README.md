# Influencer Detection
Hi I am a university student interested in Network Science. This repo is my deep-dive into influencer detection. My goals are to read papers, research, and have fun. Some papers I will implement in code others I might not, who knows.

#### Updates
- So far I have read 3 influential and fundamental papers on influencer detection. It is very neat to see how all of them interact and mingle. (07/03/25)
- Finally added some more papers. 5 more?. (11/11/25)

*Please note that the reports/code migth not include in-text citations, but the references at the bottom of each report were used to guide the implementation and analysis.*
